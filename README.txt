Status:      Works!

== What is this? ==

RaceStandings is an rFactor 2 plugin.
It is most useful when you are hosting races on a dedicated rF2 server.

== What does it do? ==

It exports the full race standings to a text file every time the leader completes a lap.
It activates only in Race sessions and writes to a file called "\Path\To\rFactor2\RaceStandings.csv".

== Why? ==

Because it sucks when a dedicated server crashes and there's no way to reconstruct the race situation from an official source.
This plugin will export the full race standings every time the leader completes a lap.
This could be a very long time for tracks like the Nordschleife, but this is how it works today.

== Installation ==

Copy the RaceStandings_x64.dll into your rFactor2 plugins folder,
most likely a directory like this:

  "C:\Program files (x86)\rFactor2\Bin64\Plugins"

== For feedback ==

Feedback on bugs, feature requests, generous donations :)
etc... are appreciated:
